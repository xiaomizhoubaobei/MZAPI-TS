## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our project very seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities in the project, please contact us through the following methods:

- Send an email to: [tongzhi@x.mizhoubaobei.top](mailto:tongzhi@x.mizhoubaobei.top)
- Create a private security report on GitHub (recommended)

### Report Content

Please include the following information in your report:

1. Detailed description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Potential impact scope
4. Suggested fix (if any)

### Handling Process

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. We will assess the severity of the vulnerability and develop a fix plan
3. After the fix is completed, we will release a new version and publicly acknowledge your contribution
4. We will keep the vulnerability information confidential until the fix is complete

## Security Best Practices

### Dependency Management

- Regularly update project dependencies using the `yarn upgrade` command
- Use `yarn audit` to check for known security vulnerabilities
- Avoid using dependency packages with known security issues
- Regularly check dependencies in `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files

### Code Review

- All code submissions must go through code review
- Pay special attention to code involving sensitive operations such as authentication, authorization, and data processing
- Ensure that sensitive information (such as keys and passwords) is not hardcoded in the code
- Check the security implementation of API calls to ensure that authentication information is properly protected

### Deployment Security

- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Regularly rotate keys and certificates
- Restrict access permissions to production environments
- Use environment variables or secure key management services to store sensitive information

## Security-Related Configuration

### Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables to manage sensitive configuration information, such as cloud service authentication credentials. Please ensure:

- Do not commit environment variable files to the version control system
- Properly set environment variables in production environments
- Use strong passwords and keys
- Avoid storing plaintext sensitive information in environment variables

### Logging

- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Regularly check and clean log files
- Ensure proper access permissions for log files
- Use appropriate log levels to avoid recording sensitive data

### API Security

As this project is a multi-cloud provider TypeScript SDK, we pay special attention to the following API security practices:

1. **Authentication Information Protection**:
   - Securely manage cloud provider authentication credentials in client code
   - Avoid leaking authentication information in code, configuration, or logs
   - Implement appropriate authentication credential rotation mechanisms

2. **Request Signing**:
   - Ensure all API requests are verified using appropriate signing algorithms
   - Regularly review and update signing algorithms to ensure secure hash algorithms are used
   - Verify the integrity of API responses

3. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit
   - Implement end-to-end encryption mechanisms
   - Use industry-standard encryption algorithms

4. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all API request parameters
   - Prevent injection attacks and data tampering
   - Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms

## Vulnerability Classification and Severity

### Critical
- Vulnerabilities that lead to authentication information leakage
- Vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access to user data
- Vulnerabilities that could cause service interruption

### High
- Vulnerabilities that could lead to data leakage
- Vulnerabilities that allow privilege escalation
- Vulnerabilities that could affect service availability

### Medium
- Information leakage vulnerabilities that do not contain sensitive data
- Vulnerabilities that could affect partial functionality
- Security issues caused by configuration errors

### Low
- Information leakage vulnerabilities with non-sensitive data
- Configuration recommendations or best practice issues

## Security Updates

We commit to:
- For critical and high vulnerabilities, release patches or mitigation measures within 72 hours
- For medium vulnerabilities, assess and develop a fix plan within 7 days
- For low vulnerabilities, fix in the next version
